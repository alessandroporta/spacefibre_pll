# SpaceFibre PLL

The aim of this project is to realize a model and a simulation with ADS of a SpaceFibre compatible 6.25GHz PLL, implemented using the SG25H4 0.25 Âµm SiGe BiCMOS technology from GlobalFoundries.
The main reference of this project is the work done [here](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/14/4013).

The main focus of this project is on the implementation of a rad-hard PFD and charge pump, whereas the VCO is modeled as ideal.
